# MyLibrary
 Personal Library System 
 
### About the Application:
- Mvc is used as a design pattern in personal library system. It consists of the initials of the words MVC, Model, View,                 Controller, and each word represents a different layer of MVC.
- MSSQL database was used by using the Entity Framework structure in the model layer of the application.
 HTML5, CSS3, JS front ends created in the view layer.
 Requests from the client were processed in the controller layer.
 With the arrangements made in routing, the request made by the client to the application was directed to the appropriate Controller and Action.
